        <br></br>
          <p>I started my journey in Digital World from an young age designing, editing and creating stuff on Web.
            I did my studies in Paris beginning with a HND in communication, then a Bachelor Degree in Digital Marketing.
            <br/>
            <br/>Now Iâ€™m 23 years old and I am pursuing my Art Director Degree specialized in Web Developement at ECV Digital Paris.
            Web development is one of my center of interest, such as Design and Yoga : fields where there is always something new to learn!
            <br/>
            <br/>Most of all I like to share and pass on my knowledge with the other through chat, classes or social media.
